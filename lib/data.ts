    desc: "Just how many calories you need in a day varies with your gender, age, weight and activity level, with the most common number being 2,000 calories. Because it's the most common, the FDA uses 2,000 calories as a base to determine daily values of various nutrients (that's why 2,000 calories is also the reference number used on the Nutrition Facts Panel on packaged foods). If you want to lose weight rather than maintain a healthy weight, that number will change. So what does a 2,000-calorie diet look like? And is it the best calorie goal for you and your needs? Start by estimating your daily calorie goal and see how much food you get on a well-balanced 2,000-calorie-a-day diet (you can compare it to the 1,200-calorie and 1,500-calorie versions).How Many Calories Should I Eat to Lose Weight? This simple calculation can help you estimate how many calories you need to maintain your current weight or lose a healthy 1 to 2 pounds per week. Most people will lose weight following a 1,500-calorie diet. This formula also assumes the person using the equation is sedentary. If you're an active person, you may find you need more calories than what you calculated to feel satisfied during the day. The best gauge for whether you're at the right level is how satisfied you feel (you shouldn't be hungry all day) and, if weight loss is a desire, whether you're actually losing weight. Of note: If you calculate a daily calorie goal that's less than 1,200, set your calorie goal back up to 1,200 calories. Below that, it's hard to meet your nutrient needs—or to feel satisfied enough to stick with a plan. Your metabolism is likely to slow below 1,200 calories a day, too, which can have long-term consequences on your weight.",

If you want to lose weight rather than maintain a healthy weight, that number will change. So what does a 2,000-calorie diet look like? And is it the best calorie goal for you and your needs? Start by estimating your daily calorie goal and see how much food you get on a well-balanced 2,000-calorie-a-day diet (you can compare it to the 1,200-calorie and 1,500-calorie versions).How Many Calories Should I Eat to Lose Weight? This simple calculation can help you estimate how many calories you need to maintain your current weight or lose a healthy 1 to 2 pounds per week. Most people will lose weight following a 1,500-calorie diet. This formula also assumes the person using the equation is sedentary. If you're an active person, you may find you need more calories than what you calculated to feel satisfied during the day. The best gauge for whether you're at the right level is how satisfied you feel (you shouldn't be hungry all day) and, if weight loss is a desire, whether you're actually losing weight. Of note: If you calculate a daily calorie goal that's less than 1,200, set your calorie goal back up to 1,200 calories. Below that, it's hard to meet your nutrient needs—or to feel satisfied enough to stick with a plan. Your metabolism is likely to slow below 1,200 calories a day, too, which can have long-term consequences on your weight.",
